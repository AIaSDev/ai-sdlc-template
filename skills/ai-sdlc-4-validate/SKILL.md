# PHASE 4 — VALIDATE

## Fast Track exception

For eligible Fast Track work, follow the validation plan recorded under
`AGENTS.md`: run relevant regression/tests for behavior changes or content/link
checks for documentation-only changes. Record commands or checks, actual results
and omitted checks with reasons in the active task entry. Required CI and review
still apply. This replaces the full release-readiness checklist below for this
scoped change only: do not claim the repository is release-ready, create unrelated
Docker/release files, or publish/deploy as a side effect. Record phase 4 with this
limited validation scope. If scope exceeds Fast Track criteria, use the regular
flow; a later release still needs its normal validation.

## Goal

Verify that the repository is **release-ready**.

Focus on **checking existing artifacts**.

## Steps

### 1. Run Local Tests

Run the project-specific unit and integration test commands documented in
`docs/PROJECT.md`.

Verify:

- unit tests pass
- integration tests pass

---

### 2. Verify E2E Tests

Check:

tests/e2e/

Extend existing tests if needed.

Create tests only if none exist.

---

### 3. Verify Dockerfile

Check:

Dockerfile

Verify the container builds and starts the application.

Create only if missing.

---

### 4. Verify CI

Check:

.github/workflows/ci.yml

CI should run:

- unit tests  
- integration tests

Create only if missing.

---

### 5. Verify Release Workflow

Check:

.github/workflows/release.yml

Verify it:

- builds the container
- runs E2E tests
- publishes the artifact

Create only if missing.

---

## Rules

- Prefer **verifying and extending existing artifacts**.
- Create files only if they do not exist.
- Avoid duplicate workflows.

---

## Output

Unit and integration tests pass.

Repository verified.
